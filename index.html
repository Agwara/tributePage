          We can say withput a semblance of doubt that she was a woman who had an interesting life. She was curious,
          intelligent and talented. She traveled and changed residence many times from a young age. She was the first to
          do many things on the big screen when films were still made in black and white: she was a star. But she also had
          great and resoursful mind, that made her learn from everything available around her; she did experiments and made
          inventions. One of which is very present in our daily life nowadays.
